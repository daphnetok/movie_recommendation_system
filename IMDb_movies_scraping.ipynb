    "# Movie details scraping from TMDB (https://www.themoviedb.org/movie)\n",
    "### columns scraped:\n",
    "- movie title\n",
    "- movie overview (description)\n",
    "- movie rating\n",
    "- movie genre\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total data scraped: 8000 rows, 4 columns (first 400 pages)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Background: \n",
    "Many show streaming platforms sort their shows and movies into various categories and genres, to give viewers a gist of what to expect when starting a new series or movie. Furthermore, this catalogued system gives viewers a comprehensive and personalised experience from the convenience of their device. However, the downside of this large influx of content might make it difficult for streaming services to allocate time and resources for such manual tagging. For example, Netflix employs the help of ‘Netflix taggers’ who watch the show for them and tags the various content. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Objective: \n",
    "- This project aims to implement an Automated Genre Tagging system for the movie website that accurately categorises and organises movies using relevant keywords and categories, without requiring manual input from staff. \n",
    "- Our sub objective is to create a personalised Movie Recommendation system based on user input and preferences. This feature will enable users to discover and watch movies they’re likely to be interested in, while reducing the need to scroll through irrelevant titles, giving them a seamless, personalised experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scraping process:\n",
    "1. Scraped all the href links of each movie which leads to their individual detailed movie page containing their overview and genre. e.g. https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/536554\n",
    "2. Performed pagination which allowed me to scrape all 4000 pages of movies' detailed pages (URL). Each page contains 20 movies. The list containing all 8000 movie detail page links is called full_list.\n",
    "3. Finally start web scraping the movie details: title, rating, genres and overview of each movie by downloading each link's html (movie) and scraping each movie html using functions.\n",
    "4. Loop it 8000 times to get every single movie's details and store them into lists (title_list, tag_genre_list, overview_list, ratings_list)\n",
    "5. Place the lists into a dictionary\n",
    "6. Convert dictionary into dataframe\n",
    "7. Write the dataframe into a csv file for text pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjustments made: \n",
    "In the proposal, it was stated that each group member would scrape movies of the genres that were allocated to them. However for my website, there is no way for me to scrape only a certain genre as the website's genre filter will be reseted everytime the website is refreshed. Therefore, I scrapped more movies than my group members and will then filter out and use only my allocated genres in my Text Pre-processing notebook's data cleaning step. Other than this genre matter, our scraped movie data format is actually the same, we have the same order and number of columns, thus we do not need an extra merging dataset notebook."
